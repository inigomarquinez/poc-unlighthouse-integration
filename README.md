🧪 PoC for integrating the Unlighthouse tool in a CI environment.

## ℹ️ What is Unlighthouse?

Unlighthouse is a tool that helps you identify and fix accessibility issues in your web applications. It provides a set of rules and guidelines to ensure that your application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

## 🚀 How to run

The repository contains a [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/unlighthouse.yml) that runs Unlighthouse based on a specific configuration stored at [`unlighthouse.config.ts`](unlighthouse.config.ts). You can use this action to check your application for accessibility issues and generate a report.
